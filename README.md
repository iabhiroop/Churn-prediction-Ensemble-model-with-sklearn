# Churn_prediction_Ensemble_model_with_sklearn

This repository is an example of an ensmeble model done with the given dataset without the use of sklearn's ensemble methods. A total of 6 models are part of the ensemble.
The models used are Logistic regression, Decision tree, Support Vector Classifier, naive bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and random forest classifier. 
The data is split into a train-test split for training and testing the final ensemble model.
Created bags for each model from the train data split. Fit the train data bags created to each model. Use the test data and classify the test data using the ensemble model.
